    "**1) Fine-Tuning on a training set:-** It is the most natural way to teach the model knowledge, but it can be time-consuming and expensive. It also builds long-term memory, which is not always necessary.\n",
    "   \n",
    "**2) Model Inputs:-** Model inputs means inserting the knowledge into an input message. For example, we can send an entire book or PDF document to the model as an input message, and then we can start asking questions on topics found in the input message. This is a good way to build short-term memory for the model. When we have a large corpus of text, it can be difficult to use model inputs because each model is limited to a maximum number of tokens, which in most cases is around 4000. We can not simply send the text from a 500-page document to the model because this will exceed the maximum number of tokens that the model supports.\n",

      "The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is a component of the Java™ Runtime Environment that improves the performance of Java applications at run time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Java programs consists of classes, which contain platform-neutral bytecodes that can be interpreted by a JVM on many different computer architectures. At run time, the JVM loads the class files, determines the semantics of each individual bytecode, and performs the appropriate computation. The additional processor and memory usage during interpretation means that a Java application performs more slowly than a native application. The JIT compiler helps improve the performance of Java programs by compiling bytecodes into native machine code at run time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The JIT compiler is enabled by default, and is activated when a Java method is called. The JIT compiler compiles the bytecodes of that method into native machine code, compiling it \"just in time\" to run. When a method has been compiled, the JVM calls the compiled code of that method directly instead of interpreting it. Theoretically, if compilation did not require processor time and memory usage, compiling every method could allow the speed of the Java program to approach that of a native application.\n",
      "\n",
      "JIT compilation does require processor time and memory usage. When the JVM first starts up, thousands of methods are called. Compiling all of these methods can significantly affect startup time, even if the program eventually achieves very good peak performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In practice, methods are not compiled the first time they are called. For each method, the JVM maintains a call count, which is incremented every time the method is called. The JVM interprets a method until its call count exceeds a JIT compilation threshold. Therefore, often-used methods are compiled soon after the JVM has started, and less-used methods are compiled much later, or not at all. The JIT compilation threshold helps the JVM start quickly and still have improved performance. The threshold has been carefully selected to obtain an optimal balance between startup times and long term performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a method is compiled, its call count is reset to zero and subsequent calls to the method continue to increment its count. When the call count of a method reaches a JIT recompilation threshold, the JIT compiler compiles it a second time, applying a larger selection of optimizations than on the previous compilation. This process is repeated until the maximum optimization level is reached. The busiest methods of a Java program are always optimized most aggressively, maximizing the performance benefits of using the JIT compiler. The JIT compiler can also measure operational data at run time, and use that data to improve the quality of further recompilations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The JIT compiler can be disabled, in which case the entire Java program will be interpreted. Disabling the JIT compiler is not recommended except to diagnose or work around JIT compilation problems.\n",

      "\n",
      " In both aggregation and composition, an object of one class can be the owner of an object of another class.\n",
      "\n",
      " in an aggregation relationship, the life cycles of parent objects and child objects are independent. In a composition relationship, the death of a parent object also means the death of its children.\n",

      "\n",
      " 1)An association is a “using” relationship between two or more objects in which the objects have their own lifetime and there is no owner.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an example, imagine the relationship between a doctor and a patient. A doctor can be associated with multiple patients. At the same time, one patient can visit multiple doctors for treatment or consultation. Each of these objects has its own life cycle and there is no “owner” or parent. The objects that are part of the association relationship can be created and destroyed independently.\n",

      "2)Aggregation(HAS-A Relationship) is a specialized form of association between two or more objects in which each object has its own life cycle but there exists an ownership as well.\n",

      "\n",
      "3) Composition(PART-OF Relationship ) is a specialized form of aggregation. In composition, if the parent object is destroyed, then the child objects also cease to exist. Composition is actually a strong type of aggregation and is sometimes referred to as a “death” relationship. As an example, a house may be composed of one or more rooms. If the house is destroyed, then all of the rooms that are part of the house are also destroyed.\n",
